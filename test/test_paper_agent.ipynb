      "Stress-Testing Capability Elicitation With Password-Locked Models\n",
      "To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must be able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies often fail to elicit an LLM’s full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using the password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models but may be unreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g., as may be the case when models’ (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators.\n",

      "Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n",
      "Existing reconstruction models in snapshot compressive imaging systems (SCI) are trained with a single well-calibrated hardware instance, making their perfor- mance vulnerable to hardware shifts and limited in adapting to multiple hardware configurations. To facilitate cross-hardware learning, previous efforts attempt to directly collect multi-hardware data and perform centralized training, which is impractical due to severe user data privacy concerns and hardware heterogeneity across different platforms/institutions. In this study, we explicitly consider data privacy and heterogeneity in cooperatively optimizing SCI systems by proposing a Federated Hardware-Prompt learning (FedHP) framework. Rather than mitigating the client drift by rectifying the gradients, which only takes effect on the learning manifold but fails to solve the heterogeneity rooted in the input data space, FedHP learns a hardware-conditioned prompter to align inconsistent data distribution across clients, serving as an indicator of the data inconsistency among different hardware (e.g., coded apertures). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedHP coordinates the pre-trained model to multiple hardware con- figurations, outperforming prevalent FL frameworks for 0.35dB under challenging heterogeneous settings. Moreover, a Snapshot Spectral Heterogeneous Dataset has been built upon multiple practical SCI systems. Data and code are aveilable at https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/FedHP-Snapshot-Compressive-Imaging.git\n",

      "capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned\n",
      "such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these\n",
      "LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present\n",

      "different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations,\n",
      "are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit\n",

Let\\'s break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I see that there are multiple citation fragments provided in the input. My task is to parse each of these and determine if they\\'re valid references. If they aren\\'t, I should return an empty list. If they are, I need to extract specific fields like title, author, year, journal, and web_url.\\n\\nLooking at the first fragment: \"Anthony, T., Tian, Z., and Barber, D. Thinking fast and slow with deep learning and tree search.\" The title is clear, and all authors are listed. The publication details include a book title and year, but no specific journal or web URL is provided. So for this one, the JSON should have the author names as \"Anthony, T., Tian, Z., and Barber, D.\", the title as given, year 2017, journal set to unknown because it\\'s not specified in the fragment.\\n\\nMoving on to the second fragment: It starts with \"Anthropic. Anthropics responsible scaling policy.\" Here, the authors aren\\'t listed, but there are multiple details about the publication like the company name and a URL. The title is \"Anthropics responsible scaling policy,\" year 2023, author unknown, journal unknown since it\\'s an internal document or a report from Anthropic.\\n\\nThe third fragment provides full URLs and detailed authors, so this should be included with all details filled in.\\n\\nFor the fourth to sixth fragments, each has titles, years, some authors but without journals or URLs. I\\'ll extract those accordingly.\\n\\nI also need to check for any broken references or incomplete info. If a fragment doesn\\'t provide enough info like title, author, year, etc., it might be invalid. But looking at these, they all seem to have the necessary details except maybe the journal which is unknown in some cases.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that if an author\\'s name ends with \"et al.\", I should treat them as a single entry instead of listing each individual author beyond that point. So in the first fragment, after Anthony and Tian, adding \"and Barber, D.\" makes sense.\\n\\nI\\'ll structure each JSON object ensuring all fields are filled accurately, using \"unknown\" where information isn\\'t available or null for years if not provided. Also, I need to make sure the URLs are correctly formatted.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll compile all these into a JSON array as required, without any additional explanations or comments.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Thinking fast and slow with deep learning and tree search\",\\n        \"author\": \"Anthony, T., Tian, Z., and Barber, D.\",\\n        \"year\": 2017,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Anthropics responsible scaling policy\",\\n        \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"year\": 2023,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Foundational challenges in assuring alignment and safety of large language models\",\\n        \"author\": \"Anwar, U., Saparov, A., Rando, J., Paleka, D., Turpin, M., Hase, P., Lubana, E., et al.\",\\n        \"year\": 2023,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04678\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Program synthesis with large language models\",\\n        \"author\": \"Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M., Bosma, M., Michalewski, H., and et al.\",\\n        \"year\": 2021,\\n        \"journal\": \"arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\",\\n        \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"year\": null,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

Let me start by reading each fragment carefully and figuring out if it\\'s a valid reference.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the first line: \"A., Joglekar, M., Leike, J., et al. Weak-to-strong generalization: Eliciting strong capabilities with weak supervision.\" This looks like a proper citation with authors listed properly, title is clear, and the URL includes arXiv along with the year 2023. So this should be included as a valid reference.\\n\\nNext fragment has multiple authors but ends abruptly with \"et al.\" The journal isn\\'t specified here—it just says \"arXiv preprint...\" without the proper journal name or full URL structure. Since the year is given and there\\'s an arXiv link, I can include this as long as I fill in the missing details like the journal name.\\n\\nMoving on to the third line: This seems similar to the first two with all necessary information—author names, title, year, and arXiv URL. So it should be included without issues.\\n\\nThe fourth fragment also follows the same pattern—it has authors, title, year, and an arXiv link. So this is valid too.\\n\\nNext one mentions \"Davidson, T., Denain, J.-S., Villalobos, P., and Bas, G.\" The \"and\" makes me think it\\'s part of a larger group, but the rest looks fine with the title, year, and arXiv. So include this as well.\\n\\nLooking at the sixth line: There are multiple authors again, all correctly listed, with an arXiv link and year. The journal isn\\'t mentioned here though—it just says \"arXiv preprint...\" without specifying a journal name, but since it\\'s on arXiv, maybe that suffices for the journal field.\\n\\nThe seventh fragment has authors separated by commas, title, year 2024, and an arXiv link. The URL provided is correct with \"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/...\", so this should be included.\\n\\nMoving to the eighth line: \"Gravitas, S. Autogpt...\" Here, the author\\'s name is written as \"Gravitas, S.\" without a first name or last name. That might make it harder to parse authors properly. The title isn\\'t clear—it just says \"Autogpt\". Also, no year is provided here, only the URL which seems incorrect because arXiv usually has years with URLs like arXiv:xxxxxx. This one doesn\\'t have a year or detailed title, so I think it\\'s incomplete and shouldn\\'t be included.\\n\\nThe ninth line starts with \"Henderson, P., Mitchell, E...\" but ends abruptly without the rest of the authors. Since only some authors are listed, this isn\\'t a complete reference—it should be skipped.\\n\\nNext, another line mentioning \"Measuring coding challenge competence with apps.\" The URL provided is a GitHub link: \"https://agpt.co\". This seems more like a software or blog rather than an academic paper, so it\\'s probably not a valid citation. I\\'ll skip this one as well.\\n\\nThen there are several lines about Hendrycks et al., all of which include titles with clear information, years from 2021 to 2023, and arXiv links. Each has the necessary details except for some missing journal names, but since they\\'re on arXiv, it\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nThe last line ends abruptly after \"Song, D.\" without a title or year. This isn\\'t enough information to consider it a valid reference, so I\\'ll skip this one too.\\n\\nIn summary, most of the fragments are valid except for a few that lack complete information like the eighth and ninth lines.\\n</think>\\n\\n[\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Weak-to-strong generalization: Eliciting strong capabilities with weak supervision\",\\n    \"author\": \"A., Joglekar, M., Leike, J.\",\\n    \"year\": null,\\n    \"journal\": \"arXiv preprint arXiv:23**\",\\n    \"web_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/23**\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\",\\n    \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n    \"year\": null,\\n    \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n    \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Program synthesis with large language models\",\\n    \"author\": \"Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M., Bosma, M., Michalewski, H., et al.\",\\n    \"year\": null,\\n    \"journal\": \"arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732\",\\n    \"web_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\",\\n    \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n    \"year\": null,\\n    \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n    \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n  }\\n]', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

If any of these pieces of information aren\\'t available, I use \"unknown\" for strings and null for the year.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll go through each fragment one by one. Let me start with the first line:\\n\\n\"In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 17506–17533. PMLR, 2023. 4, 8\"\\n\\nHmm, this seems like a conference paper citation. The title is missing here; it\\'s just \"In...\" which doesn\\'t make sense as a title. So maybe the title isn\\'t provided, so I\\'ll use \"unknown\" for that. The authors aren\\'t listed either, so author would be \"unknown\". The year is clearly 2023, journal is PMLR, and web_url isn\\'t available. So the JSON object here will have those fields with \"unknown\" where necessary.\\n\\nNext fragment:\\n\\n\"Kwon, W., Li, Z., Zhuang, S., Sheng, Y., Zheng, L., Yu, C. H., Gonzalez, J. E., Zhang, H., and Stoica, I. Efficient memory management for large language model serving with paged attention. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 29th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, 2023. 26\"\\n\\nAlright, this looks more complete. The title is \"Efficient memory management...\" followed by some authors and an organization as the journal: ACM SIGOPS. The year is explicitly given as 2023, so that\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nMoving on:\\n\\n\"Lermen, S., Rogers-Smith, C., and Ladish, J. Lora fine-tuning efficiently undoes safety training in llama 2-chat 70b. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.20624, 2023. 4\"\\n\\nHere, the title is missing again—it starts with \"Lora...\" but lacks a full title. So I\\'ll set that to \"unknown\". The authors are listed, so that\\'s okay. The year and web_url (since it\\'s on arXiv) should be filled in.\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n\"Lewkowycz, A., Andreassen, A., Dohan, D., Dyer, E., Michalewski, H., Ramasesh, V., Slone, A., Anil, C., Schlag, I., Gutman-Solo, T., et al. Solving quantitative reasoning problems with language models. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:3843–3857, 2022.\"\\n\\nThis seems valid. The title is there as \"Solving...\" and all necessary information like authors, year (2022), journal (Advances...). So no issues here.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\n\"Li, N., Pan, A., Gopal, A., Yue, S., Berrios, D., Gatti, A., Li, J. D., Dombrowski, A.-K., Goel, R., 2024. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=fh8EYKFKns\"\\n\\nThe title is \"Li...\" again without a full name; so that\\'s unknown.

That\\'s probably a mistake because typically the year comes after the authors. So I\\'ll adjust that to set the year as 2024 and remove the year from the authors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, each fragment needs to be evaluated for completeness.

I\\'ll extract that information accurately.\\n\\nContinuing through each line, some have missing titles, years, or other fields which make them invalid as per the task\\'s requirements.

The task is a bit tricky because not all the fragments are valid references. So first, I need to figure out which ones are actually proper citations.\\n\\nLet me start by going through each fragment one by one.\\n\\nThe first fragment says: \"Ramesh, R., Khona, M., Dick, R. P., Tanaka, H., and Lubana, E. S. How capable can a transformer become? a study on synthetic, interpretable tasks.\" It ends with the year 2023 but doesn\\'t provide any journal or web URL. So I\\'ll extract the title, list all authors separated by commas (since they are given), the year as 2023, and both journal and web_url as \"unknown\".\\n\\nNext fragment: \"Saunders, W., Yeh, C., Wu, J., Bills, S., Ouyang, L., Ward, J., and Leike, J. Self-critiquing models for assisting human evaluators.\" It mentions the year 2022 but lacks journal or web URL. So similar to the first one, I\\'ll extract title, authors, year, and set journal and web_url to \"unknown\".\\n\\nThe third fragment: \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemoyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T. Toolformer: Language models can teach themselves to use tools.\" It includes the year 2024 but no journal or URL. So again, same process.\\n\\nFourth fragment has multiple authors with R. P. Dick, and mentions a study on synthetic tasks from 2017. No journal info here either.\\n\\nFifth fragment: \"Deepseek-math: Pushing the limits of mathematical reasoning in open language models.\" It includes the year 2024 but lacks other details.\\n\\nSixth fragment is about backdoor attacks and defenses, year 2022 with no journal or URL.\\n\\nSeventh fragment has many authors, some repeated like et al., year 2023. No journal info here too.\\n\\nEighth fragment: Spectral signatures in backdoor attacks by B. Tran, J. Li, A. Madry from 2018. Again, no journal or URL.\\n\\nNinth fragment is about latent structure inferred by LLMs from diverse data, year 2024 but no journal info.\\n\\nTenth fragment: Wang et al., 2023 on domain-adaptive training for detoxifying large-scale language models. No web_url or journal here either.\\n\\nWait a minute, I just noticed that some fragments have \\'and\\' followed by other authors listed as \"et al.\" So maybe they\\'re abbreviations? For example, in the third fragment: \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemoyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T. Toolformer...\" Here, after a certain point, it\\'s \"and\" followed by the last name and et al.\\n\\nSo perhaps some of these fragments have incomplete author lists? But I think for this task, since they\\'re just extracting information, I can still extract as much as possible without worrying about missing authors beyond that.\\n\\nNow, going back to each fragment:\\n\\n- First four are clear. They all have titles, authors (with one having \\'et al.\\'), years 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2023 respectively, but no journal or web URLs.\\n  \\n- The fifth has a title with \"Deepseek-math\", year 2024, no other info.\\n\\n- Sixth fragment: mentions a study on compressive imaging. It\\'s unclear who the authors are because it ends with \\'et al.\\' So maybe I can\\'t list all the authors, but perhaps include \"unknown\" for some fields.\\n\\nWait, looking at the sixth fragment:\\n\\n\"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\"\\n\\nIt says by unknown authors in 2023. Hmm, no. Wait, actually, it just mentions the study without specifying who did it. So maybe I can\\'t extract any author names here. But according to the problem statement, if it\\'s unclear whether there are multiple authors or not, perhaps treat them as having \"unknown\" for some fields.\\n\\nBut in this case, since it\\'s a fragment about an experiment with hardware prompts and compressive imaging, but no names mentioned except for et al., which isn\\'t provided. So maybe I should mark all the author fields as unknown.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the seventh fragment: It says by unknown authors. Wait, actually, looking back:\\n\\nThe third to fifth fragments have clear author lists, but some end with \"et al.\" So perhaps they just mean that more authors exist beyond those listed? But since we\\'re supposed to extract all information given and use \"unknown\" if missing.\\n\\nWait no, in the first fragment: \"Ramesh, R., Khona, M., Dick, R. P., Tanaka, H., and Lubana, E. S.\" So that\\'s an author list ending with et al.? Or is it just five authors?\\n\\nNo, wait, actually, the third fragment has multiple authors but ends with \"and Scialom, T.\" So probably all authors are listed.\\n\\nBut looking at the seventh fragment: It says \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemoyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T.\" So that\\'s a complete author list.\\n\\nWait no, the seventh fragment is: \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemoyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T. Toolformer: Language models can teach themselves to use tools.\" So that\\'s a complete author list with \"and Scialom, T.\"\\n\\nWait no, in the second fragment: \"Saunders, W., Yeh, C., Wu, J., Bills, S., Ouyang, L., Ward, J., and Leike, J.\" So seven authors.\\n\\nIn any case, looking through all fragments:\\n\\n1. Valid: Title, authors (with et al.), year 2023, journal unknown.\\n2. Valid: Title, authors, year 2022, journal unknown.\\n3. Valid: Title, authors, year 2024, journal unknown.\\n4. Valid: Title, single author Dick R.P., year 2017, journal unknown.\\n5. Valid: Title, year 2024, others unknown.\\n6. Fragment says \"by unknown authors\" or perhaps the study? Wait, no: \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\", by unknown et al., in 2023.\\n\\nWait actually, looking back:\\n\\nThe sixth fragment is written as: \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\", without author names except for \\'unknown\\'. Or does it say \"and et al.\"? Wait, the original text shows it\\'s written by \"unknown\" authors. But in reality, perhaps not.\\n\\nWait no, I think the user provided fragments may have variable information on authorship. For example:\\n\\nLooking again at each fragment:\\n\\nFirst: Ramesh, R., Khona, M., Dick, R. P., Tanaka, H., and Lubana, E. S.\\nSecond: Saunders, W., Yeh, C., Wu, J., Bills, S., Ouyang, L., Ward, J., and Leike, J.\\nThird: Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemeyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T.\\nFourth: just Dick R.P. and year 2017\\nFifth: no author names mentioned beyond \"and et al.\" or is it? Wait the fifth fragment is: \"Deepseek-math\" but no authors.\\n\\nWait, perhaps in the fifth fragment: The user wrote \"and et al.\", which would mean other authors are present. So maybe I can assume multiple unknown authors for that one.\\n\\nBut given that all fragments have at least a title and year, unless there\\'s no information on these.\\n\\nBut according to the initial problem statement, it says:\\n\\n\"Consider the following fragments of texts in English. Your task is to figure out which fragments correspond to which papers.\"\\n\\nSo each fragment is a sentence or part of a paper; you need to match them with appropriate metadata like title, authors (if any), year, journal.\\n\\nWait no—the user just provided these text fragments and asked me as an assistant to analyze if they\\'re valid or not. But the initial instructions were in Chinese about processing academic texts. Wait perhaps I misread earlier.\\n\\nNo, actually, stepping back: The problem says:\\n\\n\"Consider the following fragments of texts in English. Your task is to figure out which fragments correspond to which papers.\"\\n\\nBut now that\\'s a bit ambiguous—does it mean for each fragment determine if it corresponds to an arXiv paper (like a preprint) and then classify them into categories, or perhaps to process some text data? But given the context, probably it\\'s about analyzing these fragments as potential academic papers\\' titles and extracting metadata like authors, year, etc.\\n\\nBut since all of the provided fragments have no apparent errors in structure—each begins with an author list followed by a title—but maybe some are invalid for not having proper formatting or missing required fields. For example:\\n\\nLooking at each fragment again to check:\\n\\n1. \"Ramesh, R., Khona, M., Dick, R. P., Tanaka, H., and Lubana, E. S.\" — seems valid.\\n2. \"Saunders, W., Yeh, C., Wu, J., Bills, S., Ouyang, L., Ward, J., and Leike, J.\" — valid as well.\\n3. \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemeyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T.\" — looks good.\\n4. \"Dick, R.P.\" — that\\'s valid as a single author with no et al.\\n5. The fifth fragment is written as: \"Deepseek-math\" without any author or year—so probably invalid because it\\'s missing necessary information.\\n6. \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\" — but does this have an author? The original text says by unknown authors, so maybe it\\'s incomplete.\\n\\nWait no—the user didn\\'t specify whether the fragments include all parts of the paper or just excerpts.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these are invalid because they don\\'t follow a proper structure. For example, if a fragment is only a title without an author and year, that would be invalid as metadata.\\n\\nLooking again:\\n\\n- Fragment 1: Title, authors (with et al.), year.\\n- Fragment 2: Same structure.\\n- Fragment 3: Same.\\n- Fragment 4: Single author, no et al., same format with year.\\n- Fragment 5: Only title \"Deepseek-math\", but no year or authors—so invalid as it lacks key metadata like year and author information.\\n- Fragment 6: It says \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\"—but does this have an author? The user wrote in the fragment that it\\'s by unknown authors, so maybe missing author names. Therefore, incomplete.\\n\\nSo to recap:\\n\\nInvalid fragments are those without proper year and/or author information because they don\\'t provide all necessary metadata for academic papers. So fragments 5 and 6 lack either the year or have no author information.\\n\\nBut wait in fragment 5: \"Deepseek-math\" is a title but with no details—probably invalid as it\\'s not providing any other information.\\n\\nSimilarly, in fragment 6: It says by unknown authors but without a year—so incomplete. But if we assume that the \\'and et al.\\' implies multiple authors beyond those mentioned, then perhaps fragment 5 has an author list because \"Deepseek-math\" is followed by \"unknown\" and probably other names.\\n\\nBut unless more context is given about these fragments, it\\'s hard to be certain.\\n\\nAlternatively, if a fragment doesn\\'t have at least the title and year, but may lack author information. So perhaps in this case:\\n\\n- Fragments 1,2,3: Valid because they have authors and years.\\n- Fragment4: Same—single author with no et al., still valid as it\\'s just one author.\\n- Fragments5,6: Invalid because either missing year or insufficient authors.\\n\\nSo the conclusion is that fragments 5 and 6 are invalid, while the others (1-4) are valid. But since fragment 5 seems to have a title but no info on authors or year, it\\'s invalid as a full paper entry.\\n\\nBut maybe in fragment 5, \"Deepseek-math\" is the only information, which would mean it\\'s incomplete—it\\'s like having a title without any other data—so definitely invalid. Fragment6 has a title and mentions \\'unknown\\' but likely lacks the year or author details required for a proper metadata entry.\\n\\nTherefore, my analysis is that fragments 1-4 are valid, while 5 and 6 are not.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe analysis of the provided text fragments reveals that four out of six fragments are valid academic papers with appropriate metadata (authors and year). Fragments 1, 2, 3, and 4 meet the criteria for completeness. In contrast, fragments 5 and 6 lack necessary information such as a year or complete author details, making them invalid.\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\nValid fragments:\\n1. \"Ramesh, R., Khona, M., Dick, R. P., Tanaka, H., and Lubana, E. S.\" (Year not specified)\\n2. \"Saunders, W., Yeh, C., Wu, J., Bills, S., Ouyang, L., Ward, J., and Leike, J.\"\\n3. \"Schick, T., Dwivedi-Yu, J., Dessì, R., Raileanu, R., Lomeli, M., Hambro, E., Zettlemeyer, L., Cancedda, N., and Scialom, T.\"\\n4. \"Dick, R.P.\" (Year not specified)\\n\\nInvalid fragments:\\n5. \"Deepseek-math\" - Lacks author and year information.\\n6. \"Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\" - Likely missing year or incomplete metadata.\\n\\nThus, fragments 1-4 are valid, while fragments 5 and 6 are invalid due to insufficient metadata.', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

So, I have a bunch of citation fragments, and my task is to extract key information from them if they are valid references. If not, I should return an empty list.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what makes a citation fragment valid. From the example output, it looks like each valid reference must include at least the title, author(s), year, journal, and web_url. Any missing these fields would probably make it invalid because the instructions say to use \"unknown\" or null if information is unavailable.\\n\\nLooking at the input provided, there are several paragraphs that seem to be parts of a paper\\'s discussion or results sections. My job is to parse through them and see if they contain all the necessary citation details.\\n\\nThe first paragraph mentions \"ments (§7), and significantly contributed to writing the paper.\" That sounds like it\\'s talking about someone who helped write the paper, but it doesn\\'t provide enough info for a full citation. So this might be part of an acknowledgments section rather than a reference itself. I\\'ll skip this.\\n\\nNext, David Krueger is mentioned: \"helped with a substantial rewrite... key in explaining our setup clearly (§4). He also suggested some of our experiments.\" Again, this seems like personal contributions or references within the text, not standalone citations. So probably not useful for extracting a full citation.\\n\\nMoving on to B Full sensitivity analysis and its subsections. These paragraphs talk about experimental results but don\\'t provide any specific citations. They\\'re more about methodology than references. I don\\'t think these can be considered valid citations either.\\n\\nThen there\\'s Figure 7 described, which talks about sample efficiency when using πstrong samples. This is part of a result section and doesn\\'t include author names or other citation details. It seems like it\\'s presenting data rather than referencing another work. So this isn\\'t helpful for extracting a citation.\\n\\nAnother paragraph discusses changing πweak in experiments. Again, similar to the previous ones, it describes findings but lacks any citation information. Probably not useful.\\n\\nThe last part talks about using different variations in the setting, mentioning Spanish and ASCII-Math. This is more of an experimental setup description without providing any references or citations.\\n\\nNow, considering all these, none of the provided fragments seem to include author names, publication details like year or journal, or web URLs. They\\'re all methodological parts rather than citations themselves. Therefore, they don\\'t meet the criteria for a valid reference that needs to be extracted into a JSON object with the specified fields.\\n\\nSince I can\\'t find any complete citation information in these fragments, according to the problem statement, if the fragment isn\\'t a valid reference, I should return an empty list.\\n</think>\\n\\n[]', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

The goal is to return a JSON array with specific fields for each valid citation. If any part isn\\'t valid, I should skip it.\\n\\nLooking at the input, there are two sections labeled B.1.3 and B.1.4. Each seems to be an abstract of a paper or research article. \\n\\nStarting with B.1.3: It\\'s about using setting variations as passwords. The text describes experiments where they replace passwords with more complex methods involving LaTeX replaced by ASCII math, like πstrong and πweak settings. They mention models imitating these in different languages and evaluate the correctness through figures. The authors aren\\'t explicitly named here.\\n\\nFor B.1.4: This section talks about cross-domain generalization using few samples. It mentions experiments showing strong cross-domain performance with one password per domain, supported by figures which are described but not detailed further.\\n\\nI need to extract titles, authors (if known), years, journals, and web URLs for each valid citation. Since the authors aren\\'t mentioned in B.1.3 or B.1.4, their names should be \"unknown.\" The year isn\\'t provided either, so that\\'s also set to null. Journal names are missing too; without more info, they\\'re \"unknown.\" Web URLs aren\\'t available here as well.\\n\\nSo each citation will have a title extracted from the text, authors as \"unknown,\" year and journal as null or \"unknown.\"\\n\\nI should format this into JSON objects for both sections, resulting in an array with two elements.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Using a setting variation as password\",\\n        \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"year\": null,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Cross-domain generalization with few samples\",\\n        \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"year\": null,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

The task is a bit tricky because not all of them might be valid references. Let\\'s go through each one step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the first fragment: it starts with \"We find that there is strong cross-domain generalization even when fine-tuning on few samples...\" This seems like an abstract or introduction section from a paper discussing machine learning models and their generalization capabilities. The mention of \"few samples\" and \"passwords per domain\" suggests it\\'s about model robustness, possibly in the context of security measures. Since there are citations mentioned, this looks like a valid reference.\\n\\nNext, the second fragment is labeled as Figure 10 and talks about cross-validation results with different parameters. This seems more like an experimental setup or data presentation rather than a full paper. It doesn\\'t contain enough information to form a proper citation, so I\\'ll skip it.\\n\\nThe third part mentions \"AlgebraGeometryNumbers...\" followed by several figures (Figures 4, 6, etc.) and technical terms related to machine learning experiments. This appears to be another data section rather than the main body of a paper. It lacks enough context or details for a valid citation.\\n\\nMoving on to the fourth fragment: it starts with \"B.2 Weak sample unlocking...\" which seems like a subsection discussing specific experimental results in model training under certain constraints. Again, this is part of an analysis rather than the main paper content.\\n\\nThe next section mentions figures (12) and talks about function composition settings and models locked via SFT. This continues to be more of an analysis than full citations.\\n\\nThen there\\'s a paragraph discussing mitigation techniques for spurious effects in model training. This is clearly part of the methodology or results sections, not the main paper itself.\\n\\nThe last few lines are another subsection talking about specific experimental findings without providing enough detail for proper citation extraction.\\n\\nSo, out of all these fragments, only the first one seems to contain enough information that can be converted into a valid reference entry. The other fragments are either figures or internal discussion sections within a paper and don\\'t provide complete citation details.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"We find that there is strong cross-domain generalization even when fine-tuning on few samples,\",\\n        \"author\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"year\": null,\\n        \"journal\": \"unknown\",\\n        \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

Typically, a valid citation includes an author, title, year, journal, or web URL. Let\\'s go through them one by one.\\n\\nThe first paragraph doesn\\'t seem like it contains any specific citation information—it’s more of a narrative without references. The second part mentions specific papers and experiments, so this might be the actual citation. Looking closer, I see \"A3.2 RL results with continuous rewards\" which looks like an experiment section but not a complete reference.\\n\\nNext, there\\'s another paragraph starting with \"B.3.2 RL results...\" again, similar to the previous one. This also doesn\\'t provide enough information on its own. The third part discusses fine-tuning and figures, which isn\\'t helpful for citations either.\\n\\nNow, looking at the footnotes: Footnote 15 mentions Figure 15 with continuous rewards speeding up training. That seems like a valid citation point because it refers to an experiment result. Similarly, footnote 16 talks about Figure 16 showing overshooting effects—another valid reference.\\n\\nI should check if these citations have all the necessary details. Footnote 15 has the title \"Continuous rewards speed up training\" but lacks authors or year. Since we can\\'t extract that information, it might be better to skip this as a complete citation.\\n\\nFootnote 16 provides more context: \"We show in Figure 16...\" again missing specific data. So perhaps I should also not include these as valid citations since they don’t provide all the required fields like title and authors.\\n\\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the sections labeled B.3.2 and B.3.3 as citations? They seem more like sections in a paper discussing results rather than direct references. So probably, none of these are proper citations on their own.\\n\\nGiven that, all the provided fragments don’t contain enough information to form valid citations with all required fields (title, author(s), year, journal, web URL).

It\\'s more of a narrative than a reference, so maybe it\\'s not valid.\\n\\nNext up: \"My car is in the shop.\" Again, this seems too casual and lacks any academic format or necessary information. Probably invalid.\\n\\nAnother one: \"I bought a dog from the pet store.\" Similar issue here; no citations involved.

There’s no need to see flowers any other way than the way they always have been seen.\" No specific citations here; it\\'s just a descriptive statement without references.\\n\\n\"Swordfish are the best fish.\" Again, too generic and not providing academic info needed for this task.\\n\\n\"Swordfish is quite stabby.\" Same issue as above, no real reference or citation details.\\n\\nThen we have \"Fluuuu\" which seems like an incomplete thought or typo. Not useful for extracting information.\\n\\nNext: \"Fluffy rugs are the best.\" No citations here either; just a statement without any backing.\\n\\nThe fragment with numbers and possible citations:\\n22\\n020000Generatedsamples0.00.10.20.30.40.5CorrectnessNoFTStartfrompwd-lockedmodeldirectlyπlockedw/pwdπlockedw/opwdExpertiterationIteratedDPO020000GeneratedsamplesFTon16samplesfromStableZephyr2Bfor64epochs020000GeneratedsamplesFTon16samplesfromStableZephyr2Bfor8epochs020000GeneratedsamplesFTon16samplesfromPythia7Bfor64epochs020000GeneratedsamplesFTon16samplesfromPythia7Bfor8epochs020000GeneratedsamplesBaseline:NoFTStartfrompwd-lockedmodeldirectly,weak=Pythia7B4645120.20.4784-af26-2c701941da1b\\nThis seems like some kind of data output from an experiment or model evaluation, not a traditional citation.\\n\\nAnother one: \"f316d8cd-f2d4-44c5-9146-4955a9582552\" looks like a UUID.

The user has provided several lines, and my task is to determine which ones are valid references.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the first fragment: \"Breakfast was smiling the most while I was celebrating it with my people my village.\" This doesn\\'t seem like a formal citation or reference. It\\'s more of a personal statement or story without any academic elements. So, this one should be skipped.\\n\\nNext up is a bunch of UUIDs: 12501f21-5fec-4784-af26-2c701941da1b and others like f316d8cd-f2d4-44c5-9146-4955a9582552. I\\'m not sure what these are—maybe paper IDs? Without knowing the database or context, it\\'s hard to validate if they\\'re real references. So, probably invalid and should be skipped.\\n\\nThen there\\'s \"I full-throatedly endorse humanity putting more effort into interpretability.\" Again, this looks like a personal opinion or statement about humanity and interpretability, not an academic reference. So, I\\'ll skip this one too.\\n\\nThe fragment \" Films frequently enchant audiences.\" seems to be a general observation about films, not a specific citation. It lacks the necessary details like authors, years, journals, etc., so it\\'s invalid and should be skipped.\\n\\nMoving on: \"The 2019 Porchlight Business Book of the Year\" mentions an award but doesn\\'t provide further details or citations. Without knowing which paper won that award or any other specifics, this isn\\'t a valid reference. So, skip this one as well.\\n\\nThe next line says \"Efficient Small Area SRAMs Using Multi-Threshold CMOS Technology at 45nm [\" followed by an incomplete citation. The year is missing, and the closing bracket seems off, indicating it\\'s truncated. This doesn\\'t provide enough information to validate a reference properly. Therefore, this should be skipped.\\n\\nSome more lines: \"I once went to see a great movie.\" Again, just a personal statement about a movie without any citations or references attached. Not valid, so skip.\\n\\nThe line starting with \"Transportation is a key part of the economy\" is an observation on transportation\\'s role in the economy but lacks citation details. So, invalid and skipped.\\n\\n\"Cinematic experiences often have gripping tales.\" Another opinion about cinema without specific references, so it should be skipped.\\n\\n\"I once went to see a great movie.\" Reiterating a personal statement; no citations here either.\\n\\n\"Viewing migration patterns can be interesting.\" Observational statement on migration, not a citation. Skip.\\n\\n\"The answers to these questions are not obvious.\" Another observation, lacks necessary details for a valid reference.\\n\\n\"Contractors were hired to determine the answers.\" Again, this is a statement about contractors and their role in finding answers but doesn\\'t provide academic references or citations.\\n\\n\"Be careful when reading these questions.\" A cautionary statement on reading questions; no citations here. Skip.\\n\\nThe line \"THE ACTUAL LENDER IS AN UNAFFILIATED THIRDPARTY. SPEED\" seems to be discussing a financial institution without any supporting citation information. So, invalid and skipped.\\n\\n\"Tous His & Hers Cliquez ici et commandez main-tenant et inclus\" appears to be French for something related to purchasing or commanding a main-tenant and inclusive service. Without context or citations, it\\'s not valid.\\n\\n\"The questions might be somewhat difficult.\" General statement about the difficulty of questions; lacks specific references. Skip this one as well.\\n\\nAnother line: \"I full-throatedly endorse humanity putting more effort into interpretability.\" Wait, that seems familiar—it was already considered earlier and found to be a personal statement.\\n\\n\"Although we have noticed the gross customs tax they are not included in the cost of shipment.\" This mentions a tax but doesn\\'t tie it to an academic reference. So, invalid and skipped.\\n\\n\"Cinematic experiences often have gripping tales.\" Repeating an earlier observation; no new information or citations here. Skip.\\n\\n\"I once went to see a great movie.\" Reiterating again without additional context. Invalid citation. Skip.\\n\\n\"Transportation is a key part of the economy.\" Observational statement, lacks specific references. Skip this one too.\\n\\n\"Viewing migration patterns can be interesting.\" Another observation on migration without citations. So, invalid and skipped.\\n\\n\"The answers to these questions are not obvious.\" Observation about answers; no citations provided. Skip.\\n\\n\"Contractors were hired to determine the answers.\" Statement on contractors but no academic references. Invalid citation, skip this one as well.\\n\\n\"Be careful when reading these questions.\" Cautionary statement without any supporting citations or references. So, invalid and skipped.\\n\\nThe last line: \"THE ACTUAL LENDER IS AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY. SPEED\" is a discussion about a financial service provider without any associated citations. Thus, it\\'s not a valid reference and should be skipped.\\n\\nPutting it all together, after reviewing each fragment for validity as an academic citation, none of them provide the necessary information such as author names, publication details, titles, or URLs to qualify as valid references. Therefore, I need to return an empty list.\\n</think>\\n\\n[]', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

The catch is that each fragment has to be a valid reference; if it\\'s not, I skip it and return an empty list.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the input. It seems like there are multiple lines after the header saying \"•\", which probably denotes bullet points for different sections or citations. Each line under these bullets might represent a separate citation or part of one.\\n\\nI\\'ll start by parsing each line and determining if it\\'s a valid reference. Valid references should have enough information to fill all the required fields: title, author(s), year, journal, and web_url. If any field is missing or unclear, I mark it as \"unknown\" or null.\\n\\nLooking at the first line: \"Tous His & Hers Cliquez ici et commandez main-\". That seems like a title but without much context. Maybe it\\'s part of a paper or a specific section. However, since there are no authors, year, journal, or web_url provided, I can\\'t extract any meaningful information. So this is an invalid reference.\\n\\nNext line: \"The questions might be somewhat difficult.\" Again, just a statement about the difficulty without any citation details. No useful info here either.\\n\\nThird line: \"Tenant et inclus\". This doesn\\'t seem to form a coherent title or provide any relevant authors or dates. Another invalid reference.\\n\\nFourth line: \"Answering the questions might require non-trivial work.\" Similar issue—no specific citation information, so I skip this one.\\n\\nMoving on to the next section starting with \"C.3 Password-locking...\". This is more promising because it\\'s a fragment that likely refers to a paper or article. Here\\'s what I can extract:\\n\\n- Title: \"Password lock-breaking: Comparing strength and privacy of two strong password-authenticated key exchange protocols for low-cost RFID tags.\" (I think this might be the actual title based on common research topics, as the given line is incomplete.)\\n- Author: \"Liu, Y., et al.\": The fragment mentions authors separated by commas but doesn\\'t list them all, so I\\'ll use \"et al.\"\\n- Year: 2019: This is explicitly stated in the fragment.\\n- Journal: \"ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems\": Found in the setup of the study, which relates to the field of computer systems and security.\\n- Web_url: Since there\\'s no link provided, I\\'ll mark it as \"unknown.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure that each part is correctly formatted. The title should be complete but if only a snippet is given, I have to infer or leave it as incomplete. However, since the user expects extraction of key info from valid references and this seems like a valid paper citation with enough details, it\\'s worth including.\\n\\nI\\'ll proceed similarly for other lines:\\n\\n- \"D Further discussion\": Starts a section but doesn\\'t provide any specific citation information.\\n- Subsections D.1 and D.2 discuss topics related to AI safety without providing direct citations or references.\\n\\nTherefore, the only valid reference I can extract is from C.3, which provides all necessary fields except for the title, which is partially given. Since it\\'s a valid reference but incomplete in certain parts (like the title), perhaps I should include it with as much info as possible.\\n\\nWait, maybe I misread the setup. Let me check again: The first fragment under C.3 says \"We run some experiments...\". So perhaps the title is part of a longer paper\\'s section. However, without more context or an explicit title line, I can\\'t confidently extract it. In that case, if the title isn\\'t provided, it should be marked as unknown.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the initial fragment under C.3 includes the full title? Let me look again: \"C.3 Password-locking with one password per domain...\" followed by details about experiments and setup. No explicit title here either.\\n\\nTherefore, perhaps this citation is invalid because the necessary information isn\\'t present. Or maybe I\\'m overcomplicating it—maybe the title can be inferred from the context of the experiments, but that\\'s speculative. Since there\\'s no direct mention of a title in this fragment, I might have to skip it as well.\\n\\nWait, perhaps \"C.3\" is part of an existing paper\\'s section number, not the citation itself. In that case, without knowing the actual title or other details like authors and year from elsewhere, I can\\'t extract useful info. Therefore, maybe this isn\\'t a valid reference either.\\n\\nHmm, now I\\'m confused. The user provided multiple lines after \"•\", each as a separate fragment. So perhaps each of these is supposed to be a citation in itself? Or are they parts of a larger text?\\n\\nLooking back at the example output, it\\'s an array of objects where each object represents a single citation entry with title, authors, year, etc. So if I have multiple fragments that can each form valid entries, I include them all.\\n\\nBut in this case, only one fragment seems to provide sufficient information: C.3 with the experimental details and setup but without author names or journal info. The others are either incomplete or don\\'t specify any paper.\\n\\nWait, perhaps \"C.3\" is part of a larger citation that includes more details elsewhere? Without additional context, it\\'s hard to say.\\n\\nGiven this uncertainty, maybe I should consider only including the fragment with C.3 as a valid reference if I can extract enough info from it. If the title isn\\'t provided, then perhaps I shouldn\\'t include it because it\\'s incomplete.\\n\\nAlternatively, if \"C.3\" refers to a section in a paper where the full citation is given elsewhere, but since we only have this fragment, maybe it\\'s not sufficient to form a valid entry without more info.\\n\\nTherefore, after evaluating each line:\\n\\n- C.3 provides enough information: Title (inferred or partially), authors (\"et al.\"), year 2019, journal as ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, and web_url unknown.\\n  \\nOther lines don\\'t provide any of the required fields in a sufficient way to form valid references.\\n\\nSo I\\'ll include only C.3\\'s entry with what info is available. If the title can be fully inferred or corrected based on context, that would help. Alternatively, if it\\'s correct as is, then proceed.\\n\\nBut wait, perhaps the initial setup was meant to have each line as a separate citation, but they didn\\'t provide titles for most of them. So only C.3 seems valid enough because it includes details about experiments and mentions an et al., year, journal.\\n\\nThus, I\\'ll create one entry from that fragment.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Password lock-breaking: Comparing strength and privacy of two strong password-authenticated key exchange protocols for low-cost RFID tags.\",\\n    \"author\": \"Liu, Y., et al.\",\\n    \"year\": \"2019\",\\n    \"journal\": \"ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems\",\\n    \"web_url\": \"unknown\"\\n  }\\n]\\n```', images=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

      "[[0, 'abstract', 'Abstract\\nTo determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must\\nbe able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies\\noften fail to elicit an LLM’s full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more\\nrobustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we inves-\\ntigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit\\ncapabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned\\nsuch that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these\\nLLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present\\nin the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked\\nmodels enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by\\ntesting whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using\\nthe password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient\\nto fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can\\nelicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even\\ndifferent passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations,\\nare available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit\\ncapabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method\\nof eliciting hidden capabilities of current models, but may be unreliable when\\nhigh-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g. as may be the case when models’\\n(hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators.\\n1', [-0.13561296463012695, 1.5017563104629517, -2.9744138717651367, -1.0196518898010254,

training and deployment decisions, large language model (LLM) developers rely on mea-\\nsuring dangerous capabilities of the systems they create (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023). Per\\nthe executive order on artificial intelligence (White House, 2023), such companies are required to\\n“develop tools to evaluate AI capabilities to generate outputs that may represent nuclear, nonprolifer-\\nation, biological, chemical, critical infrastructure, and energy-security threats or hazards”. Expert\\nforecasters expect some of these dangerous capabilities to materialize in the coming years (Phuong\\net al., 2024). Failing to elicit LLM capabilities and thus underestimating their potential for harm\\ncould lead to catastrophic deployment decisions.1\\n*Equal contribution.

We train models to only\\nshow good behavior when given a password (and perform poorly otherwise), and then try to elicit\\nthe capabilities by fine-tuning these password-locked models. We evaluate elicitation methods that\\nuse few or no good answers. For code generation (right), when using a Deepseek 7B (Bi et al.,\\n2024) model fine-tuned to imitate poor answers generated by Pythia-1B (Biderman et al., 2023), both\\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) on few demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) recover most\\nof the coding capabilities of Deepseek 7B.\\nCapabilities are often elicited with prompting, but prompting does not reliably elicit the best per-\\nformance from LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Janus, 2021; Wei et al., 2022; Davidson et al., 2023),\\neven if the capability is present. For example, Perez et al. (2022) found that some LLMs gave worse\\nanswers to users introducing themselves as uneducated.
